# Cookie naming style

Cookie names should:
- be all lowercase
- use underscores to separate words
- be prefixed with 'govuk'

eg "govuk_cookie_message" or "govuk_analytics_success_events"

## Don't encode organisation or software structure in a cookie name.

Organisational structure changes. The 'citizen' team no longer exists, 'data insights' is now 'performance platform'. 

If grouping is needed, group by function instead. Eg 'govuk_analytics_' or 'govuk_designprinciples_'
