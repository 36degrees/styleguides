# Git style guide

## Commit messages

Commit messages should contain:

* A short summary
  * Use no more than 50 characters
  * Start with a capital letter
  * Write in the present tense
  * Do not add a full stop
* A longer explanation, if needed
  * Leave a blank line before
  * Hard-wrap lines at 72 characters

### Example

Taken from [Tim Popeâ€™s guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

    Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

    More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
    characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
    subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
    line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
    the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
    two together.

    Write your commit message in the present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
    bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
    commands like git merge and git revert.

    Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

    - Bullet points are okay, too

    - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
      single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

    - Use a hanging indent

## Branching/merging conventions

You may often choose to work on a particular feature on a "feature branch" rather than directly on `master`. Indeed, given how cheap branches are in Git, this is [positively encouraged](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).

You are encouraged to make liberal use of Git's [history rewriting features](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) while working locally, in order to arrange your commits into appropriate logical chunks that will make sense to your fellow developers. In particular, you may find `git rebase --interactive` very useful.

When merging from a feature branch to master (or any other mainline development branch), in particular one that has previously been shared with colleagues, you should use `git merge`'s `--no-ff` option to preserve evidence of your feature branch in the repository history. This advice may be freely ignored for smaller local feature branches for which a fast-forward merge will look like any other routine development work on `master`.
